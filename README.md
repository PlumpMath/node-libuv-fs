# node-libuv-fs

**node-libuv-fs** is a rebuilt of the **nodejs** binding to **libuv**s
filesystem api. The idea behind this is quite simple. It should just give an
idea how the simple bindings work - there is no further use case.

## Installation

You can install **node-libuv-fs** by using **npm**:

    npm install libuv-fs

If you have done this you should be able to access most common apis through the
**node-libuv-fs** module.

    var fs = require('libuv-fs');

## Documentation

In the following I will list a small api documentation about the supported 
bindings.

### fs.open(path, flags, mode)

    var fd = fs.open('./README.md', 0, 0777);
    // outputs file descriptor to console
    console.log(fd);

### fs.open(path, flags, mode, cb)

    fs.open('./README.md', 0, 0777, function(err, fd) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log(fd);    
    });

### fs.read(path, buffer, offset, length, position, [callback])

    fs.open('./README.md', 0, 0777, function(err, fd) {
        var buf = new Buffer(1024);
        
        fs.read(fd, buf, 0, 1024, -1, function(err, read) {
            console.log(buf);
        })
    });

### fs.close(fd, [callback])

    fs.open('./README.md', 0, 0777, function(err, fd) {
        fs.close(fd);
    });
